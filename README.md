# **Cool-Code-Refractor

---

##_This is my first project._

What I am focusing on is making this pre-built code a little cleaner. The steps I took to do that are the following:

*Fixed bug issues
*Added a little more structure using HTML semantics
*Tweaked the style a bit more to create a more appealing user experience

---

The bug issues were simply issues with clicking links that would not take you to selected sections of the website.

---

I outlined and identified different portions of the code with HTML semantics such as:

-nav
-header
-footer
-article
-section
